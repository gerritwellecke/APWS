# Automatic Plant Watering System
This is a simple system based on the ESP8266 (in my case a nodeMCUv2 development board) which will keep my plants watered whenever I'm not home.

## Version 0.1
**Goal:** bare minimum running system.

### Future Plans
- Integration into Node-RED
- Data log for each plant
- Water sensor to warn, when reservoir needs to be filled
- Push notifications using Telegram bot
